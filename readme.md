## Getting Started
1. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
2. Run `yarn build` to build the extension
3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable developer mode
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder in the project directory
6. The extension should now be loaded and visible in Chrome

## Development
Run `yarn start` to start a Webpack watch process. This will automatically rebuild the extension when changes are made. You can then load the extension in Chrome as described above.
